    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The App I chose to make was an Inventory App, The reason for existing was to make it easy and intuitive to manage and organize a warehouse's inventory as well as offer a way to inform the users of the app if some of the inventory in the warehouse or the app's library is running low or out of stock.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens that I found were necessary for the functioning of this app a login screen, a database screen, an item creation screen, an update item screen, and a notification and other settings screen. I think I did well with the screens' simplicity without anything unnecessary that may distract or otherwise make the user not find what they are looking for.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Having never made a single Android app I relied heavily on the course material we were given through Zybooks. This helped me to understand how to make buttons and other items in Android Studio. I could potentially find myself using the skills I got in this course if I ever plan to make an Android App in the future.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used the in-built debugger in Android Studio to do the bulk of my testing, I also would run my apps on the emulator for devices which allowed me to see how the app would look and perform for a normal user on their phones or tablets. One important thing that this did early on was help me to make better names for my different variables as I easily got confused when making similar types of names for each which led to a lot of wasted time trying to find and fix all of these variables.
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One place I felt that I had innovated was the overall simplistic design that I achieved by reducing the fluff that was present in other apps that were released on the Google Play Store, I think that my app achieved this by its overly simplistic design that lends itself to be more of a rough outline of a more popular app or one with more features than what I had added
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
As I had mentioned throughout this I found my simplistic design to be the most successful part of my app, especially with the simple goals I planned to solve and the thought that if I had ever released this app to the public I wouldn't monetize it in any way especially not through any paid services or support by Ads.
