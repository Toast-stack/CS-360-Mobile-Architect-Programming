# Inventory App

## Overview

The Inventory App is designed to simplify and enhance the management of warehouse inventories. Its primary objectives are to provide users with an intuitive interface for organizing inventory items and to offer timely notifications when stock levels are low or depleted.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to protect inventory data.
- **Inventory Dashboard**: Displays a comprehensive list of inventory items with options to add, update, or remove items.
- **Add Item**: Enables users to input new inventory items with essential details.
- **Update Item**: Allows modification of existing inventory item information.
- **Settings and Notifications**: Configure notification preferences, such as receiving alerts when stock levels are low or items are out of stock.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Toast-stack/CS-360-Mobile-Architect-Programming.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   
       cd CS-360-Mobile-Architect-Programming

3. **Open the Project**:
   Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Android Studio) to begin setup or modifications.

## Usage
To run the app:
    1. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
        * Ensure you have Android Studio installed.
        * Open the project in Android Studio.
        * Connect a physical device or use the Android Emulator for testing.
    2. **Build and Run**
        * Click on the 'Run' button in Android Studio to build and deploy the app to your device or emulator.

## Development Approach
Given the lack of prior experience in Android app development, the project heavily relied on course materials, particularly those from Zybooks, to understand fundamental concepts such as creating interactive elements in Android Studio. This approach facilitated a structured learning process and ensured the app's functionalities were developed systematically.

## Testing
To ensure the app's functionality and reliability, extensive testing was conducted using Android Studio's built-in debugger and by running the app on various device emulators. This process was crucial for identifying and resolving issues related to variable naming conventions and ensuring the app's performance across different device configurations.

## Design Philosophy
A significant innovation was the app's minimalist design, aiming to reduce clutter and enhance user focus. This design choice was inspired by the desire to create a straightforward tool that addresses core inventory management needs without the complexity found in some existing applications.
